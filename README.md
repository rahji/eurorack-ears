# Ears/Brackets for Eurorack Synth Rails

This repo contains the following folders and files:

* [brackets](brackets) - files for creating brackets or "ears" for different types of rails
  * [bracket 2d files](brackets/bracket_2d_files) - DXF files suitable for laser cutting, etc.
  * [fusion 360 3d models](brackets/fusion_360_3d_models) - Fusion 360 3D designs of the ears for reference, rendering, or including in a case design
  * [shop drawings](brackets/shop_drawings) - PDF technical drawings with dimensions
* [rail profiles](rail_profiles) - accurate models and drawings of different rail types
  * [fusion 360 3d models](rail_profiles/fusion_360_3d_models) - Fusion 360 3D designs of the rails for reference, rendering, or including in a case design
  * [profile 2d files](rail_profiles/bracket_2d_files) - DXF files of the rail profiles

## Notes

* The three different rails represented are Tip Top z-rails (as supplied with the Happy Ending Kit), Vector rails (eg: TS600, TS169, etc from Mouser or Digikey), and Synthrotek rails (which have the same critical dimensions as Vector rails, but a different profile). If you're starting a project from scratch, your best bet is to purchase Vector rails. It's most economical to purchase them in longer lengths than you need, then cut them using ordinary woodworking tools.
* I normally like to include the units in the filename when saving as DXF since they are unit-less files, but I didn't here. Pay attention to the dimensions when you import - they are either mm or inches and the different should be entirely obvious when you open them. If you need instructions on how to open DXF files in Illustrator, see [my short tutorial on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EimZ205O93M).
* The holes that appear as two concentric circles in the shop drawings are countersunk mounting holes for attaching the brackets to a case. You can see this clearer in the 3d designs.
* The layout of the dimensions in the shop drawings is a bit unorthodox. It's what was useful with my vertical mill's DRO back when I made these. Don't judge - just make your own drawing from the Fusion 360 designs if you don't like the PDFs I've included. No problem.
